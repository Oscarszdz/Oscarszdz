- 👋 Hi, I’m @Oscarszdz

Autodidact. Chemical Engineer, with 1 year of Master's Degree in Advanced Technology (in the area of Biomaterials, biopolymers, applied to the treatment of breast cancer.)

MiniBio Spanish/English
I became interested in technology having seen the topic of design of experiments in my master's degree.

I started learning to program in R, to later focus on Python, taking statistics courses using this language, and then expanding my knowledge and skills, taking courses on GNU/Linux (System and Networking Administration), Tensorflow, Keras, Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Sequences, Time Series and Prediction. Natural Language Processing. Convolutional Neural Networks).

As hobbies, I enjoy reading, technology and general culture, playing the guitar, running and helping others solve their doubts.
